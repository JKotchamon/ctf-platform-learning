<h2>About</h2>
<p>TinyCMS is a tiny demo that stitches pages together on the fly.</p>

<!-- Beginner hint (non-spoiler): you can include plain text files.
     Examples to try:
     - /etc/passwd
     - /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  (reveals the access_log path)
-->
<p><small>Tip: This site runs on a web server with a config file. Reading that config often reveals useful paths.</small></p>
